## Chart.js API

**Charts are far better for displaying data visually than tables and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to press-gang them into use as a layout tool. They’re easier to look at and convey data quickly, but they’re not always easy to create.**

* Setting up

The first thing we need to do is download Chart.js.

* Drawing a line chart

To draw a line chart, the first thing we need to do is create a canvas element in our HTML in which Chart.js can draw our chart.

* Drawing a pie chart

Our line chart is complete, so let’s move on to our pie chart.


* Drawing a bar chart

Finally, let’s add  a bar chart to our page. Happily the syntax for the bar chart is very similar to the line chart.
