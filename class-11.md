## HTML
* ### Images
**Controlling the size and alignment of your images using CSS keeps rules that affect the presentation of your page in the CSS and out of the HTML markup.**

 You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS, just like you can for any other box. Specifying image sizes helps pages to load more smoothly because the HTML and CSS code will often load before the images, and telling the browser how much space to leave for an image allows it to render the rest of the page without waiting for the image to download. You might think that your site is likely to have images of all different sizes, but a lot of sites use the same sized image across many of their pages. For example, an e-commerce site tends to show product photos at the same size. Or, if your site is designed on a grid, then you might have a selection of image sizes that are commonly used on all pages, such as: Small portrait: 220 x 360 Small landscape: 330 x 210 Feature photo: 620 x 400


* * _Aligning images_

In the last chapter, you saw how the float property can be used to move an element to the left or the right of its containing block, allowing text to flow around it. Rather than using the `<img>` element's align attribute, web page authors are increasingly using the float property to align images


* * _Background Images_

The background-image property allows you to place an image behind any HTML element. This could be the entire page or just part of the page. By default, a background image will repeat to fill the entire box. The path to the image follows the letters url, and it is put inside parentheses and quotes.

* ### Practical Information

**To wrap up the book we are going to look at some practical information that will help you launch a successful site.**

SEO is a huge topic and several books have been written on the subject. The following pages will help you understand the key concepts so you can improve your website's visibility on search engines.

* * _On-Page SEO_
 
In every page of your website there are seven key places where keywords (the words people might search on to find your site) can appear in order to improve its findability.


The overview page gives you a snapshot of the key information you are likely to want to know. In particular, it tells you how many people are coming to your site.

There are a wide variety of sites that offer services commonly created by web developers (to save you having to build them yourself).
