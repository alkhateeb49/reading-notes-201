# Class 2

* ## HTML Text 
**There are a lot of html tags that i saw on ch2 that enhance my skills, for example :**
* * `<b>` : By enclosing words in the tag b we can make characters appear bold.
* * `<i>` : By enclosing words in the tag i we can make characters appear italic.
* * `<sup>` : The sup element is used to contain characters that should be superscript such as the suffixes of dates.
* * `<br />` : As you have already seen, the browser will automatically show each new paragraph or heading on a new line.
* * `<hr />` : To create a break between themes.
* * `<strong>` : The use of the strong element indicates that its content has strong importance. 
* * `<blockquote>` : The blockquote element isused for longer quotes that take up an entire paragraph.


* ## Introducing CSS
CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear. For example, you can specify that the background of the page is cream, all paragraphs should appear in gray using the Arial typeface, or that all level one headings should be in a blue, italic, Times typeface.

* ## Instructions JavaScript
like any new language, there are new words to learn (the vocabulary) and rules for how these can be put together (the grammar and syntax of the language).
